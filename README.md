##RSA
RSA is a way to keep information safe and private when we send it over the internet or store it on our computers.
Imagine you have a diary with your secrets written in it. You want to make sure that nobody can read your secrets except for you. So, you come up with a special lock for your diary that only you can open with a special key.
In the same way, RSA uses a special lock and key to keep our information safe. The lock is a number that is very hard to figure out, and the key is a special number that only the person who's supposed to see the information knows.
So, when you send a message using RSA, you lock it up with the special lock, and only the person who has the special key can unlock it and read the message. This way, even if somebody tries to intercept your message while it's traveling over the internet, they won't be able to read it because they don't have the special key to unlock the lock.

RSA is a type of public-key encryption algorithm that is used to secure data transmission over the internet. It is named after its inventors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who first described the algorithm in 1977.
The RSA algorithm uses a pair of keys, a public key and a private key, to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key is used to encrypt data, while the private key is used to decrypt the data. The two keys are mathematically related, but it is virtually impossible to derive the private key from the public key.
Here's a brief overview of how RSA encryption works:
    1. Key Generation: A user generates a public-private key pair. The public key is made available to anyone who wants to send an encrypted message, while the private key is kept secret by the owner.
    2. Encryption: When a user wants to send an encrypted message to another user, they use the recipient's public key to encrypt the message. The encrypted message can only be decrypted with the recipient's private key.
    3. Decryption: The recipient of the encrypted message uses their private key to decrypt the message and retrieve the original plaintext message.
RSA encryption is widely used to secure data transmission over the internet, including online transactions, email communication, and secure messaging applications. It provides a high level of security because it is very difficult to break the encryption without the private key.

How does HTTPS provide security?
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) provides security by encrypting the data that is transmitted between a web browser and a web server, preventing unauthorized access to the data.
When you visit a website that uses HTTPS, your web browser and the website's server establish a secure, encrypted connection. This is done using a protocol called SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security). SSL/TLS encrypts the data being transmitted, making it difficult for anyone to intercept and read the information.
HTTPS also uses digital certificates to authenticate the identity of the website you are visiting. Digital certificates are issued by trusted third-party organizations, called Certificate Authorities (CAs), and they contain information about the website's identity, such as its domain name and public key. When you visit a website using HTTPS, your web browser checks the digital certificate to verify that the website is legitimate and that the encryption is valid.
In addition to encryption and authentication, HTTPS also provides integrity protection, ensuring that the data being transmitted is not tampered with or modified during transmission. This is done through the use of cryptographic hashes, which are used to verify the integrity of the data.
Overall, HTTPS provides a secure and private connection between your web browser and the website's server, protecting your sensitive information from unauthorized access and tampering. It is widely used for online transactions, online banking, email communication, and any other situations where security and privacy are important.

Prime Factorization
Prime factorization is the process of finding the prime numbers that can be multiplied together to get the original number.
Here's an example of how to find the prime factorization of a number:
Let's say we want to find the prime factorization of 84.
    1. Find a factor: We can start by finding any factor of 84, such as 2, since 2 goes into 84 evenly (42 times).
    2. Divide: Divide 84 by 2 to get 42.
    3. Repeat: Now we repeat the process with 42. Find a factor of 42 (which is 2 again), divide by it to get 21.
    4. Keep going: Keep repeating the process with the new number until the result is a prime number. We find that 21 can be divided by 3 to get 7, which is a prime number.
So the prime factorization of 84 is 2 * 2 * 3 * 7, or written in exponent form: 2^2 * 3 * 7.
This means that 84 can be written as the product of these prime numbers multiplied together.
In general, finding the prime factorization of a large number can be challenging, but there are many algorithms and techniques that can be used to do so efficiently.

Why RSA? 
RSA is a popular public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure communication and data transmission over the internet. Here are a few reasons why RSA is so widely used:
    1. Security: RSA is a secure encryption algorithm that is based on the mathematical properties of prime numbers. It is difficult to break the encryption without knowing the private key, making it a secure method for transmitting sensitive data.
    2. Public-key cryptography: RSA is a public-key cryptosystem, which means that each user has a public key and a private key. The public key can be freely distributed, while the private key is kept secret. This allows for secure communication between two parties without needing to share a secret key.
    3. Flexibility: RSA can be used for a variety of applications, including digital signatures, key exchange, and secure data transmission. It can also be combined with other cryptographic algorithms for enhanced security.
    4. Widely supported: RSA is widely supported by software and hardware, making it easy to implement and use in a variety of applications.
    5. Established and proven: RSA has been around for over 40 years and has been extensively studied and analyzed by cryptographers. It has a strong track record of providing secure encryption for a wide range of applications.
Overall, RSA is a trusted and widely used encryption algorithm that provides a high level of security for transmitting sensitive data over the internet.
